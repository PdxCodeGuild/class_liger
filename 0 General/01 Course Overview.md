## Intro

### What is programming?

A program is a series of instructions given to a computer which perform operations on data, transforming input into output. We write our instructions, or 'source code' in text files, then 'run' those instructions opening those files in the python interpreter or browser.

### Why Python?

- It has a great community, active development
- It has a wide variety of libraries and resources
- It can be used for game dev, web dev, data science, etc
- It'll be easy to adapt your skills to other languages
- https://docs.python.org/3/

### Why Django?

- It has a great community, active development
- It enables the quick development of web applications
- Web dev is very popular and lucrative

## Course Overview

This course is a kick-start to learning web development, it is immersive and pragmatic. We learn by doing, and focus on understanding the principles of programming practice. Most of the class time will consist of lectures, demos, mob programming, and labs. Tutoring outside of class is free and can be scheduled with the instructor.

## Submitting Lab Solutions

Students will submit lab solutions by using `commit` and `push` to a repository and creating a link in the `README.md` to them.

## Healthy Habits

- Commit and push every day to get your progress recorded on GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket to show potential employers you're active.
- Ask for help if you've been stuck for 10 minutes, or if you don't understand a topic. Ask a neighbor, ask a TA, or ask an instructor.
- Ergonomics
  - good posture, reduce screen brightness and add a blue light filter
- When faced with a new problem:
  - consider the various tools at your disposal, what we've learned so far
  - break a big problem into more manageable chunks
  - write each step you'll take to solve the problem in comments, then fill in the code below the comment
- When you get an error:
  - read the error message carefully
  - look at where in the code it points to
  - google the error message if it's specific
- When you get stuck:
  - take a step back, re-evaluate the problem context
  - look at previous labs
  - look at the class docs, python docs, mdn, w3schools, django docs
  - look for similar examples on stack overflow
  - try extracting bits of code and running them in isolation
  - ask a fellow student, TA, or instructor
- Avoid getting burnt-out:
  - take regular breaks
  - test as you develop code to ensure you're on the write path, don't get stuck in the trap of writing a lot of code and trying to tweak the syntax
  - don't haphazardly copy-paste code from stack overflow

## Exercises

### Lectures & Demonstrations

The purpose of lectures is to introduce and explain a topic. Most lectures are followed by live demonstrations. Please do not distract yourself during lecture. These will be recorded and posted after class.

### Labs

Labs represent the bulk of the course work. Read the lab description, plan out a solution, and implement your solution in a `.py` file. Please label your solutions very clearly (`lab01.py`, `lab02.py`) and split the different versions into different files (unless the advanced version is a direct extension of the last solution).

Lab solutions must perform the function described in the lab description. All solutions must be formatted, tested, and commented in order to be considered 'complete'.

Many labs will have optional versions, which include additional features you can complete if you have the time or the desire, and may require you to do additional research. Do not work on them until you are done with the basic version of the assignment. Advanced requirements will enable you to reach into the more advanced topics of the course, and will give you a deeper understanding of the language. Unless an advanced version of a lab is labeled 'optional', it's not optional.

These labs are designed to build upon each other, and so are best completed in order. The purpose of these labs is to practice your ability to break down a problem and express solutions in code.

Make an honest attempt before you ask for help on a lab. Look carefully at the error message and where in the code it's occurring. Look through the provided resources, look at previous labs, research the problem on google and stack overflow. If you're stuck after 15 minutes of review and research, please ask for help, either from another student, a TA, or the instructor.

Don't consider an assignment 'finished' until it's been thoroughly tested. Try many different inputs and verify the output. Check for 'edge' cases or unexpected user input. I'll review your solutions from time to time and verify that they successfully fit the requirements of the assignment. If they don't, you'll need to fix them.

Once you've finished a lab, or a major portion of a lab, commit and push your work. Unless you have a good reason (building's on fire), only commit working code.

### Pair, Group, & Mob Programming

Occasionally we'll do [pair or group programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) for a lab. Ensure that neither of you is in control of the keyboard for the majority of the time. Regularly alternate roles between directing (talking about what needs to be done) and driving (actually typing).

For [mob programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming), one student will type while others discuss and decide on what to type. It is not the typists' responsibility to figure out what to write, that is the responsibility of the mob.

### Student Presentations

At the end of each section, you'll give a presentation on an assignment of your choice. This is practice for your capstone presentation which you'll give on the last day of class.

These presentations help you practice communicating technical topics in English. Being able to speak intelligently about programming is almost as important as programming itself. This skill will allow you to better talk to interviewers, managers, clients, coworkers, and more.

#### Capstone Presentation

For your capstone presentation, you should plan out what features of your project you'll want to present. The recommended order is to first talk about your inspiration, then walk them through the features of application, then talk about the development process and show some code. Here are some questions to contemplate while planning out your presentation:

- What was your inspiration? What was your vision? What problem does your application solve? what is the core function it performs?
- how did you go about planning? what major issues did you encounter during the course of development? how did you go about overcoming them?
- how did your vision for the project change over time? What fit your expectations and what didn't?
- What part did you like the most? least?
- What is the future of the project? what features (if any) will you work on next?

## Code of Conduct

At PDX Code Guild we seek to create an environment conducive to personal and professional growth. Academic and personal integrity are central to creating such an environment.

- Respect the rights of all others. Foster a safe and comfortable social environment. Show respect for every member of our community, including members of partnering communities without regard to sex, age, race, color, ethnic origins, sexual orientation, economic status, gender expression, size, physical ability, learning styles, nationality, religion, or thought.
- Treat one another in a professional manner at all times. Harassment, intimidation, humiliation, excluding or acts of bullying will not be tolerated. If you witness such acts, report them immediately to a school official.
- Refrain from disruptive behavior in the classroom, on the PDX Code Guild premises, and at any PDX Code Guild hosted event.
- Engage in conduct appropriate for an educational and professional setting, refraining from behavior that may shock or disturb others.
- Refrain from recreational drug use. Refrain from use of alcohol except in moderation at events hosted at the PDX Code Guild premises outside of class time that serve alcohol.
- No smoking, vaping or use of tobacco products on the PDX Code Guild premises except for designated areas outside. Please dispose of cigarette butts and other tobacco products in the dumpster outside.
- Refrain from using offensive or abusive language.
- Be honest and trustworthy.
- Keep the spaces you use nice for the next person. Clean and wipe up your desk area (and the floor around your desk). Remove dishes, food wrappers and crumbs. Clean up after yourself in all common areas. Wash any dishes you use.
- Refrain from wearing any strong scents (i.e. strong perfumes) in class as some class members may have allergies or sensitivities to smells.
- Maintain your dress, personal appearance and hygiene in a clean, tidy and work appropriate manner. Be courteous and take steps to minimize body odors.
- Respect the personal property of others and the property of PDX Code Guild.
- Use the work of others only when appropriate, and give proper credit when otherâ€™s work is used.
- Demonstrate dignity and integrity in all aspects of involvement with PDX Code Guild, including participation in sponsored events, and situations in which we may be seen to represent PDX Code Guild. These activities and situations include, but are not limited to events hosted by PDX Code Guild, events in the greater technology community, conferences and meetings, and your interactions with our partners and with potential employers.

## Academic Honesty

Do not look at the solution or other students' solutions until you've finished the lab yourself. Do not copy other student's code. Do not copy code off the internet unless it's a small amount and you know exactly what it means. Do not try and complete a lab by googling a tutorial. You're only inhibiting your own learning by doing so. Cheating is also a violation of our code of conduct and can result in expulsion.

You are encouraged to use resources (docs, online, books, each other) to research solutions. If you copy code from the internet or a book, you must understand what it means and how it works. If you're not sure, look up the function in the docs, try running it with a variety of inputs, and try tweaking the syntax, throw in print statements to print the values of variables at different times, etc. You also cannot use a single function which performs the entirety of the solution for you. The early labs are designed to practice string and list operations, using a function that does it all defeats the purpose.

## Attendance

Students are expected to be on time and attend all scheduled class times. The school requires ninety percent (90%) completion of class hours in order to receive a certificate of completion from the course. Students can miss no more than 7 days for the day class and 9 days for the evening class. Students can also not be absent for more than 5 days consecutively (this includes weekends).

Any Student arriving more than 15 minutes late for scheduled class time will be marked tardy. Tardiness without legitimate reason on three different occasions will be counted as one absence.
