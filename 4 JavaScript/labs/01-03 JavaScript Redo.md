# Lab 1: JavaScript Redo

## Version 1

Pick three (3) of the following Python labs and re-do them in JavaScript. You should first try to write them using JavaScript's `prompt` and `alert` in place of Python's `input` and `print`.

- Random Password Generator
- Rock, Paper, Scissors
- Unit Converter
- Credit Card Validation
- Rot13
- Number to Phrase

## Version 2 (optional)

Once you have that working, use `input` and `button` elements, with events. You can read the docs on **DOM Manipulation** and **Events**. You can view a demo [here](https://codepen.io/flux2341/pen/rJpBXe?editors=1010).
