# Let's represent an ATM with a class containing two attributes: a balance and an interest rate. 
# A newly created account will default to a balance of 0 and an interest rate of 0.1%. 
# Implement the initializer, as well as the following functions:

# check_balance() returns the account balance
# deposit(amount) deposits the given amount in the account
# check_withdrawal(amount) returns true if the withdrawn amount won't put the account in the negative
# withdraw(amount) withdraws the amount from the account and returns it
# calc_interest() returns the amount of interest calculated on the account
