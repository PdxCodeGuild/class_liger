# Lab 12: ATM

Let's represent an ATM with a class containing two attributes: a balance and an interest rate. A newly created account will default to a balance of 0 and an interest rate of 0.1%. Implement the initializer, as well as the following functions:

-   `check_balance()` returns the account balance
-   `deposit(amount)` deposits the given amount in the account
-   `check_withdrawal(amount)` returns true if the withdrawn amount won't put the account in the negative
-   `withdraw(amount)` withdraws the amount from the account and returns it
-   `calc_interest()` returns the amount of interest calculated on the account

```python
 atm = ATM() # create an instance of our class
print('Welcome to the ATM')

menu_options = {
    '1': 'Balance',
    '2': 'Deposit',
    '3': 'Withdraw',
    '4': 'Interest',
    '5': 'Exit'
}

while True:
    print()
    for label, option in menu_options.items():
        print(f'{label}. {option}')

    command = input('\nEnter the number of the option you would like to perform\n> ')
    command = menu_options.get(command)

    if command == 'Balance':
        balance = atm.check_balance() # call the check_balance() method
        print(f'Your balance is ${balance}')

    elif command == 'Deposit':
        amount = float(input('How much would you like to deposit? '))
        success = atm.deposit(amount) # call the deposit(amount) method
        if not success:
            print("Deposit amount must be a positive number.")
        else:
            print(f'Deposited ${amount}')

    elif command == 'Withdraw':
        amount = float(input('How much would you like to withdraw?\n> $'))
        success = atm.check_withdrawal(amount)

        if not success:
            print('Insufficient funds')
        else:
            atm.withdraw(amount)
            print(f'Withdrew ${amount}')

    elif command == 'Interest':
        amount = atm.calc_interest() # call the calc_interest() method
        atm.deposit(amount)
        print(f'Accumulated ${amount} in interest')

    elif command == 'Exit':
        print("Goodbye!")
        break

    else:
        print('Command not recognized')
```

## Version 2

Have the ATM maintain a list of transactions. Every time the user makes a deposit or withdrawal, add a string to a list saying 'user deposited $15' or 'user withdrew $15'. Add a new method `print_transactions()` to your class for printing out the list of transactions.
